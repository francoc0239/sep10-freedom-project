## Why the medical  industry

The topic I decided to pick for my year-long freedom project  is the medcial industry because I've was always intrested in the human body and i want to help people become the healthiest version they could be. Ever since when i was in middle school i always loved researching/learing about health science and i always wanted to know more. In the news i would always see new technological medical equipment and it always made me wonder if there will be more in the future. I considered making this project about baking or photography because i love to bake and i love learning how to take photos. But i decided that the medical industry would be the best choise because i want to know what kind of new technological inventions could come up in the future. Some of my favorite articals to these topics were.["The Impact of Baking Machine Technology on the Industry"](https://www.prorestaurantequipment.com/blog/the-impact-of-bakery-machine-technology-on-the-industry/#:~:text=Precision%20and%20Consistency,baked%20goods%20across%20the%20industry.) by Pro Restaurant Equipment, ["The Impact of Technology on Photography"](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/12/01/the-impact-of-technology-on-photography#access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dSI6Imltc19uYTEta2V5LWF0LTEuY2VyIiwia2lkIjoiaW1zX25hMS1rZXktYXQtMSIsIml0dCI6ImF0In0.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.ORw61rwKNqZ0hwuhW2eWz1doEyf4TcYto0pVe6jPL8iHLANk6Elw5wCxlYd-jE72atgWRfmU-joDeuXjNrxJ1yUaoNBZKnN7xkGDb72gmBd41TsoW-NyXbeNV81bcmNb1Hz7QfSNgA2z0pU_vsYFDNKEbTzzIayRAf1YMoiUXq6alJ5v-8SQwB9E1-mjEqwwnY-8ExRRuukLmmtpQPXF6mpkmgYczJNIFDYkQzcKrKih0m1Uh_rRKlV8wGP_ZzNwAqO-_En7j9O7lS--Xy5aNNXmUgYIGcjbuXC3VJUIbV3yq7lkZiXPUq6BnmnZ9e03QFCZ4i4QRsCTqLHCVdQ5qA&token_type=bearer&expires_in=86399997) by Adobe Communications Team. Researching which topic i wanted to pick was intresting but the website that made me pick the medical industry was ["Technology and the Future of Healthcare"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4147743/) by the National Library of Medicine, because it explained how technology has changed people lives and how futuure technology can help make more inventions that will help people. These articles helped me pick a topic and it helped me find out what i might want to do in the future.

## Engineering Design Process

I am still in the first stage of the engineering design process which is to identify the problem. The problem that I want to solve with my freedom project is that **people don't know that the world of technology is connected to the medical industry**. The next stage is to do even more research on the problem and to do that i will have to look throught websites and talk to others on the subject to gain other points of views on the problem. 

## Skills

Some of the skills i have learned while working on blog 1 are **how to research**, **time management**, and 

#### How to research 

While researching for this project, millions of resultus showed up but reading them all would take too long. What I leanred is that instead of reading all the titles I can just look for key words like technology or medical. What I also learned is that to find what your looking for, you have to use keywords in order to find the website you need. For example, instead of searching up  _technological advances_ I searched up _technological advances in the medical industry_ which helped get rid the resultus that i don't want.
