# Entry 2: The Research on My Topic (The Medical Industy)
##### 11/03/25
## What have I been doing?
 Since the last blog entry, I've been researching my topic on The Medical Industry. There are two parts to the research, Part A and Part B. Part A is to research Medical technology that is used today. Part B is to research Medical technology that could be invented and be used in the future. Right now im on Part A and while researching, I found many software and hardware technologies regarding to The Medical Industry. There are differences between software and hardware. Software are apps and websites that are used by computers to operate information. Hardware are physical electronics that you can touch and see, For example, computers, speakers, and phones. Some important Software I found during my research was a app called [My Plate](https://www.myplate.gov/app/shopsimple/desktop). This app is important because it shows you how to make amazing food while keeping the prices low. The My Plate app shows you how much you should be eating everyday and how much nutrients you should be gaining each day. This app is amazing If you want healthy snacks and a healthy life. Another app i found since my last blog is called [Mindfulness Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/mindfulness-coach). Mindfulness Coach is an app that is developed with the help of Veterans to help others pratice mindfulness. The app included auido exeercises and sets goals over time. One hardware i found is called [A Contact Lense](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/contact-lenses). A contact Lense is used by many people with vision problems. Contact lenses make it easier for people to use and there are many different types of lenses for different needs or preferences. 
 ## Engineering Design Process
 Im still on the second stage which is to find more information. For the second stage **i want people to see that there is both physical technpology and app that is related or used for in the Medical indsty and that its important to help people.** im getting close to stage 3 which is to research the future of technology in the Medical industy. For stage 3 i will have to find mofre reliabe resoucres that predict the future of technology for medical industy and how it can change peoples lives for the better.  
 ## Skills
 There are some skills I leanred while researching my topic. I also improved on some skills while researching. 
 ### Organization 
 While researching for part A, I had to learn how to organized in my notes so I could understand what I wrote. I would also have to be organized to understand the website and what its about. Before organizing my notes I would just clump them together and I would always get confused about what I wrote. I realized that i had to organize my notes by adding headings and descripctions about what I learned from the website. Because of my messy notes and not being able to read them, i decied to be organized and seperate the notes by the website and the topics it talks about. This made it much easier to understand and do the research. 
 ### How to read
 While looking for websites for Part A, I read all the words on the website or took too long to look for the website, so it took a long time to find the right app or website.
