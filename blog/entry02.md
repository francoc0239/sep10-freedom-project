## What have I been doing?
 Since the last blog entry, I've been researching my topic on The Medical Industry. While researching, I found many software and hardware technologies regarding to The Medical Industry. There are differences between software and hardware. Software are apps and websites that are used by computers to operate information. Hardware are physical electronics that you can touch and see, For example, computers, speakers, and phones. Some important Software I found during my research was a app called [My Plate](https://www.myplate.gov/app/shopsimple/desktop). This app is important because it shows you how to make amazing food while keeping the prices low. The My Plate app shows you how much you should be eating everyday and how much nutrients you should be gaining each day. This app is amazing If you want healthy snacks and a healthy life. Another app i found since my last blog is called [Mindfulness Coach](https://mobile.va.gov/app/mindfulness-coach). Mindfulness Coach is an app that is developed with the help of Veterans to help others pratice mindfulness. The app included auido exeercises and sets goals over time. One hardware i found is called [A Contact Lense](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/contact-lenses). A contact Lense is used by many people with vision problems. Contact lenses make it easier for people to use and there are many different types of lenses for different needs or preferences.
