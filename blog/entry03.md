# Entry 2: Finishing up my research (The Medcial Industry) 
##### 12/01/25
## What have I been doing? 
Since the last blog entry, Ive been researching part B of my topic on the medcial industry. There are two parts to the research, Part A and Part B. Part A is to research medical technology that is used today. Part B is to find or create medcial technology that could be invetned and be used in the future. I finished part A and now im on Part B. While brainstorming for Part B, I used my creativity to invent medcial inventions that could maybe be made. One of the ideas I created was a personal doctor robot that goes with you wherever you go. Here are the features that will go with the robot: 
  * The robot will be able to make you any medicine you need and it'll give you the right amount of medicine everytime.
  * It'll be able to take your temperature
  * It'll be able to take carec of you and give you things when you can't move
  * It'll be able to move anywhere you go at anytime
  * It has built in safe AI so it can be up to date
  * You can name the robot anything you want
  * You will have to put the robot in sleep mode for it to charge
  * The robot is very cosumizable

The robot would be very helpful for people who cant take care of themselves like disabled people, and eldery people. There is another invention that i created which is a band aid that heals your cuts and  bruises very fast. Here are the features that will go with the band aid:
* As you put on a bandaid, it heals your minor cuts and bruises in less than 5 seconds.
* It could also disinfect your cuts so you won't get sick or infected.
* The bandaid will also be flexable so it will be comfortable
* The bandaid will also be able to numb the pain so it won't hurt as much as before

The bandaid will be helpful for people who get hurt a lot and for people who want their pain to be healed quick. 
## Engineering Design Process 
After completing the second stage of the Engineering Design Process, I've moved on to the third stage, which is to organize all my research and brainstorm the solution to my problem that I want people  to recognize. For the third stage, ive been organizing my research by putting them in different catorgies. The catorgies I used is based on physcial health an mental health. Im getting closer to finishing stage 3 and going to stage 4 which is to brainstorm the design of the webpage. 
## Skills 
There are some skills that I learned while researching my topic. Some of those skills are **How to organize**, and **How to use my creativity**. 
### Organization 
While researching for Part B, I had to organize my notes in Google Docs so I can understand how my resarch will look on the webpage and to understand my writing. I had to organize my notes in sections so the people will understand how my notes will look. Before organzing my notes, I would just clump all my notes together which made me realize that the notes will be confusing for people to understand. So I organized my research into different parts so it'll be easier for me and the reader to understand. 
### How to use my creativity
For Part B I had to create a new invention that could be used in the future in the medcial industry. It was very hard to create new ideas because im not that creative. So to fix that problem i used AI to give me examples of ideas to create a new and different invention.
