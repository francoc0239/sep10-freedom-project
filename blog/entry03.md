# Entry 2: Finishing up my research (The Medcial Industry) 
##### 12/01/25
## What have I been doing? 
Since the last blog entry, Ive been researching part B of my topic on the medcial industry. There are two parts to the research, Part A and Part B. Part A is to research medical technology that is used today. Part B is to find or create medcial technology that could be invetned and be used in the future. I finished part A and now im on Part B. While brainstorming for Part B, I used my creativity to invent medcial inventions that could maybe be made. One of the ideas I created was a personal doctor robot that goes with you wherever you go. Here are the features that will go with the robot: 
  * The robot will be able to make you any medicine you need and it'll give you the right amount of medicine everytime.
  * It'll be able to take your temperature
  * It'll be able to take care of you and give you things when you can't move
  * It'll be able to move anywhere you go at anytime
  * It has built in safe AI so it can be up to date
  * You can name the robot anything you want
  * You will have to put the robot in sleep mode for it to charge
  * The robot is very cosumizable

The robot would be very helpful for people who cant take care of themselves like disabled people, and eldery people. There is another invention that i created which is a band aid that heals your cuts and  bruises very fast. Here are the features that will go with the band aid:
* As you put on a bandaid, it heals your minor cuts and bruises in less than 5 seconds.
* It could also disinfect your cuts so you won't get sick or infected.
* The bandaid will also be flexable so it will be comfortable
* The bandaid will also be able to numb the pain so it won't hurt as much as before
 
The bandaid will be helpful for people who get hurt a lot or move around a lot and for people who want their pain to be healed quick. In order to make these ideas, I used other peoples projects and ideas as examples to make up new ideas from them. [Here is a link to the document that inspired me with my ideas.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ey3sYPN4Rb_mvInMqPzlkDKUT8tCREaYln2ggvvZZW8/preview?tab=t.0) and I put the new ideas and research for part A and B [here](https://github.com/francoc0239/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/content.md)
## Engineering Design Process 
After completing the second stage of the Engineering Design Process, I've moved on to the third stage, Which is to start designing the app/webpage and put all the information that I found on that webpage. But I need to have time to brainstrom how I want the webpage to look like and I need time to know where the information will go. This plan is important because if i dont brainstrorm or plan, The app/webpage will look weird and no one would like it. 
## Skills 
There are some skills that I learned while researching my topic. Some of those skills are **How to organize**, and **How to use my creativity**. 
### Organization 
While researching for Part B, I had to organize my notes in Google Docs so I can understand how my resarch will look on the webpage and to understand my writing. I had to organize my notes in sections so the people will understand how my notes will look. Before organzing my notes, I would just clump all my notes together which made me realize that the notes will be confusing for people to understand. So I organized my research into different parts so it'll be easier for me and the reader to understand. Organization is very helful because without it, I would had forgotten to do the Introduction/Overview of my app/webpage. So now, I will have to organize so I can make sure I dont forget anything.  
### How to use my creativity
For Part B I had to create a new invention that could be used in the future in the medcial industry. It was very hard to create new ideas because I am not that creative. So to fix that problem I used other peoples projects to give me examples of ideas to create a new and different invention. The ideas people had in their projects were really good and this made it possible for me to create these ideas.
